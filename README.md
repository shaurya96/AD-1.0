# üèóÔ∏è Active Directory Home Lab Project

This project documents the complete setup and configuration of a cybersecurity Active Directory home lab for practicing enterprise security, threat detection, and security analysis in a controlled environment.

## üîç Project Overview

Active Directory is the backbone of most enterprise environments, making it critical for cybersecurity professionals to understand how to secure, monitor, and analyze AD infrastructure. This project builds a fully functional domain environment using VMware Workstation Player 17, Windows Server 2022, Windows 10, Kali Linux, and Ubuntu Server to:

- Set up and configure Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)
- Practice domain administration and security hardening
- Generate enterprise telemetry with Sysmon + Splunk for security monitoring
- Simulate attack scenarios against domain infrastructure
- Develop skills in both red-team (attack) and blue-team (defense) methodologies

## ‚öôÔ∏è Part 1: Lab Architecture Planning & Network Diagram

**Objective:** Design the lab architecture and understand component relationships

- Created comprehensive network diagram using draw.io
- Defined IP addressing scheme and network segmentation
- Mapped data flow between components (dotted green lines indicate log forwarding)

## üåê Part 3: Network Configuration & Monitoring Setup

**Objective:** Configure networking and install monitoring infrastructure

### Configuring Ubuntu Server 22.04 (Splunk Server)

- Assigned static IP addressing for the Splunk Server (`192.168.194.150`) and change Network Adapter to NAT for internet access and VM communication
- For that we edited the `00-installer-config.yaml` file using the command `sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml`

    ```yaml
    network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        ens33:
        dhcp4: no
        addresses:
            - 192.168.194.150/24   # pick an unused IP in the same subnet
        routes:
            - to: default
            via: 192.168.194.2   # confirmed gateway
        nameservers:
            addresses:
            - 8.8.8.8
            - 8.8.4.4
    ```

  - Apply and verify:

    ```yaml
        sudo netplan apply
        ip addr show ens33
        ping -c 2 8.8.8.8
    ```

- Splunk installation on ubuntu server

  - Ensure the VM has a reachable IP. As explained above, I used a static IP so the VM is easy to reach from any host in the NAT network
  - Enable SSH (fixed the ‚Äúconnection refused‚Äù error)
    - I first tried scp from my host and got:

       ```pgsql
        ssh: connect to host 192.168.194.150 port 22: Connection refused
       ```

    - Fixed inside Ubuntu VM:

        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y openssh-server
        sudo systemctl enable ssh
        sudo systemctl start ssh
        sudo systemctl status ssh    # should be "active (running)"

        ```

  - Copy the Splunk .deb into the VM
    - From my host (Windows PowerShell/CMD):

      ```bash
        scp splunk-10.0.0-e8eb0c4654f8-linux-amd64.deb shaurya@192.168.194.150:/home/shaurya/share
      ```

  - Install Splunk
    - Inside the vm

      ```bash
        mkdir share
        cd ~/share
        sudo dpkg -i splunk-10.0.0-e8eb0c4654f8-linux-amd64.deb
      ```

    - Splunk is now under `/opt/splunk` 

  - First start & license

    ```bash
        cd /opt/splunk/bin
        sudo ./splunk start --accept-license
    ```

    - On first start, Splunk prompts to set admin username/password.
    - Splunk Web listens on port 8000.

  - Enable auto-start on boot

    ```bash
        sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start
    ```

  - Log in to Splunk Web
    - From any machine on the NAT network we can access the splunk using the address `http://192.168.194.150:8000`

  <p align="center">

  <em>üì∏ Figure-7: Splunk web interface</em>
  </p>


### Configuring Windows Target Machine

- First, we will rename the windows machine to `target-PC`
- Then, we will assign static IP (`192.168.194.151`) to the machine and change Network Adapter to NAT for internet access and VM communication

  <p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/8.static-ip-assignment.png" alt="Static IP Assignment Process" width="700"/><br>
  <em>üì∏ Figure-8: Static IP assignment process</em>
  </p>

  <p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/9.static-ip-proof.png" alt="Static IP Assignment Proof" width="700"/><br>
  <em>üì∏ Figure-9: Static IP assignment proof</em>
  </p>

- Then, we will install [Splunk Universal Forwarder](https://splunk.com)
  - For the Receiving Indexer we will use the IP of Splunk/Ubuntu Server `192.168.194.150` on port `9997`

  <p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/10.splunk-uf-installed.png" alt="Splunk Universal Forwarder Installed" width="700"/><br>
  <em>üì∏ Figure-10: Splunk UF Installed</em>
  </p>

- Now, let's move to installing [Sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) in the windows machine.
  - Once installed using the above link, let's install the [configuration file](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml)
  - Run sysmon with the configuration file, using the command `.\sysmon.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml`
  
  <p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/11.sysmon-installed.png" alt="Sysmon installed" width="700"/><br>
  <em>üì∏ Figure-11: Sysmon Installed</em>
  </p>

- Now, configure the **Splunk Universal Forwarder (UF)** to ingest core Windows Event Logs (**Application, Security, System**) along with **Sysmon** logs and send them to the Splunk server, routing them into the custom index **`endpoint`**. This can be done by adding the appropriate entries in the `inputs.conf` file.
  - I used the `inputs.conf` below

    ```bash
        [WinEventLog://Application]
        
        index = endpoint
        
        disabled = false
        
        [WinEventLog://Security]
        
        index = endpoint
        
        disabled = false
        
        [WinEventLog://System]
        
        index = endpoint
        
        disabled = false
        
        [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
        
        index = endpoint
        
        disabled = false
        
        renderXml = true
        
        source = XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
    ```

  - After that, we then need to restart the `SplunkForwarder` Service
  - But before that, we need to change `Log On As` from `NT Service\Splunk Forwarder` to `Local System account`
  - In Splunk Console, create a custom index named **`endpoint`** (Splunk Web ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Indexes ‚Üí New Index) to store host telemetry and Sysmon data.

    <p align="center">
    <img src="assets/screenshots/12.endpoint-index.png" alt="Endpoint Index" width="700"/><br>
    <em>üì∏ Figure-12: Splunk Endpoint Index</em>
    </p>

### Configuring Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)

- First, of all we will rename the windows machine to `ADDC01`
- Then, we will assign static IP (`192.168.194.155`) to the machine and change Network Adapter to NAT for internet access and VM communication
- Then, we will install `Sysmon` and `Splunk Universal Forwarder` as done in the Windows Target Machine

### Data Ingestion Verification

- Verified log ingestion from both Windows machines
  <p align="center">

  <em>üì∏ Figure-13: Splunk data ingestion proof</em>
  </p>

## üèóÔ∏è Part 4: Active Directory Domain Services Installation

**Objective:** Install and configure Active Directory, promote server to Domain Controller, and join target machine to domain

### Domain Controller Setup

- Installed Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) role through Server Manager
- Promoted server to Domain Controller with new forest: mydfir.local
- **Critical Security Note:** The ntds.dit file contains all AD data including password hashes - attackers target this file specifically

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/14.AD-installed.png" alt="AD installed" width="700"/><br>
  <em>üì∏ Figure-14: ADDS installed with server promoted to DC with mydfir.local domain</em>

  <em>üì∏ Figure-15: DC login screen</em>
</p>

### Active Directory Structure & User Management

- Created Organizational Units (OUs) for IT and HR departments
- Added domain users:
  - Jenny Smith (jsmith) - IT Department
  - Terry Smith (tsmith) - HR Department
- Configured proper OU structure mimicking real enterprise environments

<p align="center">

### Domain Join Process

- Updated Target machine DNS to point to Domain Controller (192.168.194.155)
- Successfully joined Target machine to mydfir.local domain
- Authenticated with domain user Jenny Smith (jsmith)
- Verified domain authentication and user profile creation

## üéØ Part 5: Attack Simulation & Detection Analysis

**Objective:** Perform brute force attack simulation and implement Atomic Red Team for advanced testing

### Kali Linux Machine Configuration and RDP Authentication automation

- Set static IP for Kali Linux: `192.168.194.129`
  <p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/22.kali-linux-static-ip.png" alt="Kali Linux Static IP" width="700"/><br>
  <em>üì∏ Figure-22: Kali Linux Static IP assignment</em>
  </p>

- Before performing RDP authentication we need to make sure RDP is allowed
  
  <p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/23.RDP-enabled.png" alt="RDP Enabled" width="700"/><br>
  <em>üì∏ Figure-23: RDP enabled on Windows Machine</em>
  </p>

- Now, we wanted to automate testing of RDP authentication on the Windows target machine ‚Äî verifying whether weak credentials allow remote login
  - Ran Crowbar to brute-force RDP.
  - Crowbar errored: `xfreerdp not found` ‚Üí investigated.
  - Found FreeRDP v3 installed (`xfreerdp3`) ‚Üí created `symlink` `/usr/bin/xfreerdp` -> `/usr/bin/xfreerdp3`.
  - Crowbar still returned No results found ‚Üí determined Crowbar‚Äôs RDP module was incompatible with modern RDP negotiation.
  - Manually tested with `xfreerdp` (with `/sec:nla`) ‚Äî success (confirmed credentials work).
    - `xfreerdp /u:MYDFIR\\tsmith /p:********** /v:192.168.194.151 /sec:nla`
  - Switched to Hydra/Ncrack for automated brute-forcing (or used FreeRDP manually when testing single creds).
    - `hydra -t 4 -V -f -l tsmith -P passwords.txt rdp://192.168.194.151`
  - Successfully compromised Terry Smith's account through password brute forcing
  - Generated 20 failed login attempts followed by 1 successful authentication

   <p align="center">
   <img src="assets/screenshots/24.rdp-access.png" alt="RDP Access" width="700"/><br>
   <em>üì∏ Figure-24: RDP Access to Windows target machine from KALI Linux</em>
   </p>

### Splunk Detection & Analysis

- **Failed Login Analysis (Event ID 4625):**
  - Detected multiple failed login attempts within seconds - clear brute force pattern
  - Source IP traced to Kali Linux machine (192.168.194.129)
  - Temporal correlation shows rapid successive attempts indicating automated attack

    <p align="center">

    <em>üì∏ Figure-26: Splunk showing multiple Event ID 4625 (failed login) events for Terry Smith</em>
    </p>

- **Successful Authentication Detection (Event ID 4624):**
  - Identified successful login from Kali workstation
  - Correlated attack timeline: multiple failures followed by success
  - Key IOCs: Workstation name "Kali" and source IP 192.168.10.250

### Atomic Red Team Installation and Implementation

- Installed Atomic Red Team framework for MITRE ATT&CK technique testing
- Atomic Red Team (ART) is a library of tiny, repeatable tests that simulate MITRE ATT&CK techniques so you can validate detections and test defenses.
  - *Commands involved*
    - Open PowerShell as Administrator
    - Allow running scripts for this session (temporary) -> `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force`
    - Run the install command (downloads and runs Red Canary helper to fetch atomics) -> `IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/install-atomicredteam.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Install-AtomicRedTeam -GetAtomics`
    - Show details for a technique (example: Persistence `T1136`) -> `Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001 -ShowDetails`
    - Run a specific atomic test - `Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001`
  - *Issues faced*
    - `Invoke-AtomicTest` is implemented in `Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.ps1`
    - PowerShell reported it as ‚Äúnot recognized‚Äù because either:
      - the helper script/module was not installed on disk, or
      - it existed but was not imported (dot-sourced or Import-Module) into your current session, or
      - an earlier installer attempt failed due to network/DNS/proxy issues.
    - You later found `install-atomicredteam.ps1` under `C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam` and loaded it ‚Äî that‚Äôs the missing step: load the helper

## üßæ Issues faced during the project

- `Invoke-AtomicTest` not recognized
  - **Cause** - helper script/module (`Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.ps1`) either missing or not loaded into the session.
  - **Fix**

    ```powershell
        Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force #Allow running scripts for the current session

        Unblock-File 'C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\install-atomicredteam.ps1' 
        . 'C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\install-atomicredteam.ps1'
        Install-AtomicRedTeam -GetAtomics #Unblock and Load the installer and download atomics:

        Unblock-File 'C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.ps1'
        . 'C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.ps1'
        Get-Command Invoke-AtomicTest #Unblock & load the main helper, then confirm the command is available

        Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001 -ShowDetails #Run a safe preview of a test
    ```

- SSH ‚ÄúConnection refused‚Äù to Ubuntu while transferring the Splunk `.deb` file
  - **Cause** - OpenSSH-server not installed/enabled by default.
  - **Fix**

    ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y openssh-server
        sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
    ```

- Crowbar xfreerdp errors / RDP negotiation incompatibility
  - **Cause** - Crowbar expected a different FreeRDP binary; modern RDP negotiation can break older brute tools.
  - **Fix** - created symlink for `xfreerdp` (for quick tests) and moved to Hydra/Ncrack for automated brute forcing.

    ```bash
        sudo ln -s /usr/bin/xfreerdp3 /usr/bin/xfreerdp
    ```

- Splunk UF permissions / service account
  - **Cause** - default service account may not have expected log access.
  - **Fix** - set UF to run as `Local System`, configured `inputs.conf` to capture Sysmon and Windows Event channels, verified `endpoint` index in Splunk.
